        <h1 align="center">CODING</h1>
        <p>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually
        by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, 
        profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming 
        language, commonly referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are 
        intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. <br>The purpose of 
        programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an 
        operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in 
        several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

        Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems,
        and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs.</p>
